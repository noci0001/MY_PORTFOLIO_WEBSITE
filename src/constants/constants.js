    description: "The Minishell 42 project was a significant and rewarding challenge in the 42 curriculum, pushing me to explore various aspects of software development. Despite my initial intimidation, it involved creating a command-line interpreter resembling Bash, focusing on core functionalities: Operating exclusively in interactive mode Executing commands with absolute or relative paths Supporting simple commands without paths Maintaining a command history Implementing pipes, redirections, and here-doc functionality Handling double and single quotes, environment variables, and signals Including built-in commands like echo, exit, env, export, unset, cd, and pwd. The project was divided into front-end and back-end sections. The front-end managed user input and commands, while signals were addressed later to reduce complexity. The parsing journey involved two phases: lexical analysis (tokenization) and syntax analysis (parsing). Lexical analysis transformed user input into tokens, emphasizing token types over values. Syntax analysis scanned tokens based on a predefined grammar, potentially generating an Abstract Syntax Tree. Lexing was relatively straightforward, while parsing posed a considerable challenge.",

    description:"This had been a very fun project and my most important takeaway had been that no matter how hard something looks, how complex you perceive a project to be, if you make one step at a time you can face everything. This project being one of my firsts is less polished, but it makes me reflect on how cool learning and improving your skills is.",
